        >Hi, I am ranger a UI/UX designer who aims to provide you with the best
        UI possible. I know a variety of programming languages starting from HTML to a little bit of Python. I like to spend my free time programming and making website UI prototype. I am from a far far far land called USA. I am currently a student in 8th grade. I have been doing programming for over 2 years now. I love to explore new stuff and learn something new everyday. I have a certificate in a Udemy Course of Javascript by Jonas Schmedtmann, and in the CS50 harvard course. I usually spend about 2 hours everyday dedicated to programming while listening to music. If you want to hire me or talk to me you can contact me <a href="contact.html">here.</a> I make my designs prototype in figma. It usually takes me around a day or two to make the prototype. After the prototype in complete I turn my designs into code. This takes me around a week to turn the prototype into code.
